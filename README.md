## Best Anti-Cyberbullying Project - RALLYtoUS + VetsinTech Hackathon 2020 Winner
## Inspiration
## Let's start with a story
When a stranger asked Lexa if her if she could send a file she did so and that was the beginning of a nightmare. Vulgar calls from multiple numbers at ungodly hours... The constant **dread** when the phone rings.... Like Lexa thousands are **traumatized by cyber bullying**. If only Lexa had shared the file without leaving her digital footprint....
## Enter LexConnect
LexConnect is an open-source tool developed by Hrishikesh P with the vision of **NO STRINGS ATTACHED** data transfer. LexConnect transmits data using audio which makes it easy and safe to share it with strangers as it **leaves no digital footprint** if used wisely. **No more fear** of the stranger getting your phone no: or email id or even taking the risk of allowing them into your LAN. As of now, **text** and **music** can be transmitted.
##Motto
The sole motto of LexConnect is to help **reduce the risk of cyber-bullying** and **increase women safety**.
## What's next for LexConnect
Being open-source I hope LexConnect will be able to transfer more kinds of data. I myself shall work on **predictive audio-based image compression** in the coming days. The goal is to make LexConnect the Xender of the audio world.
## Tech Stack used
Tech stack comprises of React, JS, Photoshop, Illustrator, CSS & plain old HTML.
## Challenges I ran into
Where should I start ;) This is my first React project. I spent ours trying to figure out the enmity between github pages and React routes :( I had a lot of trouble figuring out the **optimum data-transfer method** that could be implemented in a day!
## Accomplishments I'm proud of
Building something that helps in making the world a **safer place for women** and making an effort to reduce cyber-bullying these are the 2 rewards I have gained during this hackathon. Nothing compares to helping others and **that is a reward in itself**.<br />

## What I learned
I have **tasted the joy of social service**. This was my first React project and I learned the beauty of the Virtual DOM. The renders are so satisfying !!!
