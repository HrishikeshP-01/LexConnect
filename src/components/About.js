                <p>Lexa was taking part in a cooking competetion when a stranger asked her if she could share her recipe and asked for her no: to do so.
                 She sent it to him.</p>
                 <p>That was the beginning of a nightmare. Vulgar calls from multiple numbers at ungodly hours ....</p>
                 <p>The constant dread when the phone rings ....</p>

                 <p>If there were more easy ways to share data without leaving a footprint wherever we go ....</p>
